% where bi define the part of the trace where the popspike is found.
% [b1 b2] is the time for the boundary of the first bump and [b3
% b4] is the boundary for the second bump. The popspike peak is found
% between these two bumps.
% If manually the three peak points were extraced, then bt is a 2-by-3
% matrix where the first row had the three time points and the second row
% has the three y values.
